       "459824      This is the best marshmallow creme<br />I have ever eaten. It is great in fudge<br />recipes. It is also great as a quick snack,<br />just grab a spoonful. It takes the craving<br />right away.<br /><br />I have also used it to make rice krispie<br />marshmallow treats since I did not have<br />marshmallows. It was pretty good, but not<br />as good as with marshmallows.<br /><br />However, I must add that since I am having<br />blood sugar problems, I restrict this to once<br />a year for Christmas fudge recipes. The fudge<br />just can't survive without it!   \n",

      "I first tried these after my sister gave me a bag of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT5NFO\">Snack Factory Original Pretzel Crisps</a>.  My family really liked them as a quick snack they could grab a handful of.  I also found them dipping them in sour cream, peanut butter, cream cheese and also adding sliced cheese.  When I saw they had flavored ones, I had to buy them and so far the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YTC9MO\">Snack Factory Buffalo Wing Pretzel Crisps</a> are our favorites. They don't work well dipped in peanut butter, but are good with all the others including ranch dressing or just by themselves.  Although the size of the bags seem small, because they are so light and crispy, you do receive quite a bit in them. On average I've paid anywhere from $2.50 to $3.50 a bag and I'm okay with that. Definitely give them a try if you like Buffalo Wings!\n",

      "Think of the little jar of hot pepper paste that your favorite dim sum or chinese food restaurant serves.  Now put it in a convenient squeeze tube, and keep it in your frig.  Tastes great, and easy to store use.  I find myself putting it on everything.\n",

      "Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!\n",

      "My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food.\n",

      "I like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CEABE\">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag</a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank.\n",
      "---\n",
      "This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets. It is so amazing!!!  Give it a few weeks and you will see the same.\n",
